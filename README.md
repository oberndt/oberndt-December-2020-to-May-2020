This is my senior project which involved me programming, using artificial intelligence software, and working with audio editing programs to create music. To successfuly create edited audio, I worked with Onset and Frames, a highly-accurate transcrption software. Onset and Frames utilizes Mangenta, a machine-learning library within Python, to make highly-accurate predictions about the location and timing of notes in a piano composition. The notes are transcribed into a malleable digital audio format known as MIDI, then I can edit these MIDI files using Cakewalk, an audio editing software. The combinination of these programs allowed me to change the instruments playing the notes to guitar, banjo, harpsichord, etc. This project provided me useful information about my career interests. I'm now studying Computer Science at IU.

I uploaded one of the IPYNB files I used in Google Co-Lab. Using these, I transcibed the piano compositions into MIDI.

Below are some samples of the music I created. These videos show the unedited versions vs the versions I edited in Cakewalk.
